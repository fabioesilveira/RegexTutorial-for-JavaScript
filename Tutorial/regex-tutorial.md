## Regex Components

## Anchors
Regular expressions are powerful tools for matching patterns in text. Anchors, which are special characters in regular expressions, play an essential role in defining the position of the pattern within the input string. In the context of email validation, like in the regex featured in this tutorial `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`, it is crucial to ensure that the entire input string matches the specified pattern, rather than just a part of it.

**Anchors Come in (2) Main Types:**
1. Start Anchor `^`: This asserts that the pattern must match the start of the string.
2. End Anchor `$`: This asserts that the pattern must match the end of the string.

Anchors essentially define the boundaries of the text that the regular expression should match. 
<br>
**Example One:** the regex `^hello$` matches only the string "hello" and nothing else. It won't match "hello world" or "say hello" because the pattern is not at the start or end of the string, respectively.
<br>
**Example Two:** the regex ^hello matches any string where "hello" is at the start of the string. It will match "hello" in "hello world", but it will not match "hello" in "world hello" because the string does not start with "hello".
<br>
**Example Three:** the regular expression hello$ matches any string where "hello" is at the end of the string.  It will match "hello" in "world hello" but it will not match "hello" in "hello world" because the string does not end with "hello".



In the context of email validation, anchors are invaluable because they help ensure that the entire email address adheres to the specified pattern. This is essential for accurate validation, as it prevents partial matches or unwanted results.
By setting boundaries at the start and end of the string, anchors guarantee that the pattern matches only the intended text. They are critical components of pattern matching in text processing, particularly when validating email addresses using a regex like `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. In conclusion, anchors play a vital role in defining the position of the pattern within the input string and ensure accurate and reliable validation.
